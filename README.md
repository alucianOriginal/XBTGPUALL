#XBTGPUALL

XBTGPUALL is an experimental OpenCL 3.0 GPU mining project aiming to create a free and open-source miner for the Bitcoin Gold (BTG) network.
It builds up on ideas from XBTGPUARC and the original Bitcoin Gold kernel math (Zhash_144_5), reworked for Intel ARC and modern GPU architectures.

üß© Project State

This project is currently in a very early, non-functional prototype stage.
It‚Äôs written and designed by an experienced miner but a total beginner in C++/OpenCL programming ‚Äî with help from modern AI coding tools.

The goal is learning by doing, not competition with existing miners.

‚öôÔ∏è Concept & Goals

Build an OpenCL 3.0‚Äìcompatible miner from scratch

Understand and document how Zhash_144_5 works at kernel level

Support Intel ARC, AMD, and NVIDIA GPUs equally

Keep the entire development transparent and educational

Encourage others to learn, modify, and contribute

üìö About the Code

Most comments and notes are bilingual (English + German) for better understanding during the learning process.
The most parts of the code were generated with AI assistance ‚Äî all logic is being reviewed, tested, and refined manually over time by my person and hardware.

üß† Learning Project

This repository is part of a long-term self-learning process in:

GPU kernel programming (OpenCL)

C++/architecture integration for miners

Optimization and cross-platform compilation

Mistakes are expected and documented ‚Äî that‚Äôs part of the process.
