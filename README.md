#XBTGPUALL

XBTGPUALL is an experimental OpenCL 3.0 GPU mining project aiming to create a free and open-source miner for the Bitcoin Gold (BTG) network.
It builds upon ideas from XBTGPUARC and the original Bitcoin Gold kernel math (Zhash_144_5), reworked for Intel ARC and modern GPU architectures.

🧩 Project State

This project is currently in a very early, non-functional prototype stage.
It’s written and designed by an experienced miner but a total beginner in C++/OpenCL programming — with help from modern AI coding tools.

The goal is learning by doing, not competition with existing miners.

⚙️ Concept & Goals

Build an OpenCL 3.0–compatible miner from scratch

Understand and document how Zhash_144_5 works at kernel level

Support Intel ARC, AMD, and NVIDIA GPUs equally

Keep the entire development transparent and educational

Encourage others to learn, modify, and contribute

📚 About the Code

Most comments and notes are bilingual (English + German) for better understanding during the learning process.
Some parts of the code were generated with AI assistance — all logic is being reviewed, tested, and refined manually over time.

🧠 Learning Project

This repository is part of a long-term self-learning process in:

GPU kernel programming (OpenCL)

C++/architecture integration for miners

Optimization and cross-platform compilation

Mistakes are expected and documented — that’s part of the process.

🪙 License

This project will be free and open under a permissive ;IT license once the base version compiles and runs.
